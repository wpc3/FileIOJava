## Output results to a file

Writing to an output file is similar to our input. The most common way to do this in Java is using the print writer. After importing the `PrintWriter`, we simply create a new file, write to it using `println` commands and then close it.

In our example, we will not be able to see the file once created but to verify that it is there, we will read it back in and print out the results. Try changing line 15 below and see the impact that it has.
